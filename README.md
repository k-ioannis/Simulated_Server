# Uni_server_project
This is a University Poject which was assigned to me. 
Main goal was to write a .c File simulating the way a Sever could handle requests.
This is achieved by creating multiple threads with 3 different attributes found in the Configuration.txt.
Then based on the Requests.txt ( containing in each line request id and time to live ) the Requests are proccessed with a mutex condition.

The code opperates heavily and contains 1 or 2 bugs which I wasn't able to solve.
